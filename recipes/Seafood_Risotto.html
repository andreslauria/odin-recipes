            <p>
                Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. <br>
                Add leek and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. <br>
                Add rice and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. <br>
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally. <br>
                Pour in remaining chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper. <br>
                Cook, stirring constantly, until remaining liquid is almost absorbed and seafood has cooked, about 5 minutes. <br>
                When rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.
